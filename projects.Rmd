## Combine Neural and Non-neural Methods for Representation-Based Information Retrieval
+ Compared the state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural information retrieval methods (such as BERT and USE-QA) with classic word-overlap based methods (such as tf-idf and BM25).
+ Conducted a probe task to show that query embedding of USE-QA encodes the information of the target document
+ Proposed a hybrid retrieval method to combine both: when the top BM25 score of the query is high, use BM25; otherwise use USE-QA.
+ Results show that the hybrid method outperforms the individual baselines on three QA-based retrieval datasets. 
+ The project is implemented with python, pytorch, tensorflow, lucene and scala. 

## Hybrid Polarity Classifier for Biomedical Events
+ Compared the LSTM-based classifier with the linguistic-knowledge-informed classifier on polarity detection of biomedical events. 
+ Integrated the LSTM classifier to Reach (a information extraction software for biomedical publications, implemented in scala). 
+ Implemented a hybrid classifier to combine the LSTM one and the linguistic one. The routing classifier works by counting the negation words in the text: if there are many negation words, use the LSTM classifier; otherwise use the linguistic classifier. 
+ This project is implemented in python, dynet and scala.
